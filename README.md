# Project 3: MY FAVOURITE THINGS
Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Design a database
that contains at least 5 columns.

## Description

Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You must have a database with at least 5 columns - you MUST have title / heading (text), image(s) and descriptive text. The last two columns are your choice.

Include a landing / splash page and a dynamic route to showcase each of your favourite things. You should have at least three views, one of which should be an error.hbs page. Use at least 2 routes. One of these routes MUST be dynamic with a route parameter.

Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use a Github repo; use Express to generate the application and the mysql package to connect to a database. Retrieve data using route parameters, and render the appropriate view with the query response as the data resource.
